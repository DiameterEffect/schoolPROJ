Need player 1  to make a bet, bet a dollar or any amount they want(scoreboard). We need to have an equal amount in the POT so player 2 must match player 1 bet(ex, p1 bets a dollar so p2 bets a dollar too).
We must add a “fade me” function where the Player bets against the other player, and whoever wins that will get the cash, and this data will be inputted in one of the players data type
Game rules(If a player rolls a 7 or an 11 with two of the dice they win the game and they take the cash. If player rolls a 2-3-12 they lose)
On the first roll of the game, for example you roll and get a number, let's say 9, you would have to roll that same number again to win the pot. This is also called your point. 
Side bets function(???), if a player wants to make a side bet they can, it’ll have to be an equal amount to put in, if one of the players rolls a 7 they lose.
